Overview
This project utilizes the STM32F407 microcontroller to generate various types of signals (sinewave, triangle wave, square wave) using the DAC module. The generated signals are then read back using the ADC module. The captured data is processed using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze frequency components.

Components Used
STM32F407 microcontroller
ARM CMSIS Library for DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
FreeRTOS for task management
STM32CubeMX for initial project setup
ARM Keil MDK for development and debugging
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Install STM32CubeMX and ARM Keil MDK to compile and flash the firmware onto the STM32F407 microcontroller.
Basic knowledge of C programming and embedded systems development.
Setting Up the Environment
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Open the project in STM32CubeMX to review and modify peripheral configurations if necessary.

Configuring the Project
Ensure the following peripherals are correctly configured in STM32CubeMX:
TIM3 for triggering ADC conversions.
TIM6 for triggering DAC updates (depending on the signal type).
ADC1 with appropriate settings for continuous conversion mode and DMA.
DAC with configurations specific to the chosen signal type.
Signal Types
SIN_WAVE: Generates a sine wave using pre-defined values stored in the sinewave[] array.
TRIANGLE_WAVE: Generates a triangle wave using the DAC's triangle wave generation feature.
SQUARE_WAVE: Generates a square wave using GPIO toggling.
FFT Configuration
FFT size (FFT_SIZE) is set to 1024, enabling analysis of frequency components up to the Nyquist limit.
ARM CMSIS DSP library (arm_cfft_radix4_f32 and arm_cmplx_mag_f32) is used for FFT processing.
Running the Project
Compile the project using ARM Keil MDK.
Flash the compiled firmware onto the STM32F407 microcontroller.
Monitor the LED (GPIOD) toggling to indicate FFT processing.
Use a serial monitor or debugger to observe FFT results and verify signal generation.
